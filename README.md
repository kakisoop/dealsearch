==========

The idea is to build a search engine that can allow you to search deals.

Here are couple of things, that I am thinking about.

1. I need to use an algorithm to figure out the accounts that post twitter deals.
2. I need to then remove duplicate deals.
3. Bookmark can be done by retweeting the deal
4. Favorite a tweet will make the count go up
5. Users can subscribe for periodic emails.

Future project ideas:
1. The next step is to build a social network based on twitter, where users can sign up using twitter and then use tweets and retweets to comment on stuff. They can find users with similar interests. We can define a protocol based on twitter to provide all options of a social network.
2. The idea is to take wikipedia dump and let users follow the pages they are interested in and showing them tweets about them and the same idea of allowing them to tweet. It can be a educational social network where one can share wikipedia links and comment on it.
3. The idea is to figure out hashtags for a particular topic and the post them based on that.
4. The next idea is to experiment with compressing twitter text and allow users to post for greater than 127 characters
5. The next idea is to create a image of text and allow users to post greater than 127 characters.
6. The next idea is to build a question answering system based on twitter.
